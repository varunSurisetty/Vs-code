Time complexity - 
    • Ω omega - best possible execution time - usually finding 1 in 1 to 7 list. 
    1	2	3	4	5	6	7
    • Θ theta - average possible execution time - usually finding 4 in list
    1	2	3	4	5	6	7
    • O Omicron - worst possible execution time - usually finding 7 in the list
    1	2	3	4	5	6	7
